# Detecting passenger discomfort from abnormal driving manoeuvres

Abnormal driving manoeuvres such as sudden braking, harsh acceleration or swerving can impose serious risks for people participating in the traffic. This study focus es on the detectionof passenger discomfort by inferring the underlying abnormal driving events that cause suchexperiences. E xperiments for threshold based techniques are conducted on real world datacollected from smartphones on heterogeneous cars and drivers , where the passengers provideddiscomfort annotations . Accurate detection is found on sudden acceleration events at 82% andhard braking events at 96% By detecting these abnormal driving manoeuvres, drivers can bealarmed when their driving behaviours cause passenger discomfort.
